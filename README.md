# Battleship
Making the Battleship Board Game

Language: Java

-This version of Battleship is slightly different form the conventional board game (a more simplified version)
Two modes: 
  -fast mode (player vs computer) with randomized ship placement, and the user trying to figure out the computer configuration
  -regular mode (player vs player) with one player setting up the ship configuration manually, while the other user tries to guess the configuration in the least number of guesses
